## Introduction

Design patterns are common solutions to recurring problems in software design. Understanding these patterns can greatly improve your coding skills and software architecture. This repository aims to serve as a practical guide for learning and implementing design patterns.

## Design Patterns Included

### Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. 

**Example Usage**: Creating a unique database connection.

### Adapter Pattern

The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.

**Example Usage**: Integrating a new system with a legacy system.

### Strategy Pattern

The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

**Example Usage**: Implementing different sorting algorithms.
